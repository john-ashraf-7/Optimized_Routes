The Project intensively compares the adjmatrix implementations of 3 different shortest path algorithms
Dijkstra, Bellmanford, and A star
and calculates the execution time for each.
It is implemented in OOP to simulate the project delivery routes prompt
So we have drivers, and maps.
Each driver can be given any map, any src and destination, then he should be able to find the shortest distance to there. using 3 different algorithms
and also determine which algorithm is more efficient.
