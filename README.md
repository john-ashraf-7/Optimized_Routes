<h1>Multi-Vehicle Route Optimization | Efficiency Comparison</h1>
<p>
    This repository contains an individual project for the 
    <i>Analysis & Design of Algorithms</i> lab. The project leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to design a program that assigns routes to multiple drivers, aiming to minimize overall travel time. Additionally, it provides an in-depth comparison of the execution time of three Shortest Path algorithms, evaluating their efficiency and performance.
